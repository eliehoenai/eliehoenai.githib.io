<blockquote style="font-family:georgia;color:black;">"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-family:georgia;color:black;">-Proverbs 9:10</blockquote>

<p style="font-family:georgia;color:rgb(68,68,68);">If the fear of the Lord is only the <i>beginning</i> of wisdom, wisdom altogether encompasses much more. However, a cognizance of the beginning can inform the end. In that case, what does it mean to fear the Lord, and to what does such a fear lead? Traditionally, people ascribe to its meaning a sense of reverence rather than strict fear because of the negative connotation and seeming contradictory nature of fearing a loving God. Ignore this for a moment.</p>

<p style="font-family:georgia;color:rgb(68,68,68);">In the literal sense of the word, we <b>fear</b> God because we know that He holds the ultimate power. Power over creation, over life and death. Wisdom starts here because it recognizes God's sovereignty. From the very beginning, God always held control. One not in control could not have created the entire universe. This sovereignty then informs how we should conduct ourselves throughout our life: according to the ways of the one in control. Otherwise, we risk an ultimate death. From here arise the commands of the Old Testament, most notably the Ten Commandments.</p>

<p style="font-family:georgia;color:rgb(68,68,68);">However, wisdom cannot end here, for these commands in fact tell us to love God. John states, "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment" (1 John 4:18). Therefore, we cannot both fear and love God. This could appear contradictory. We were just told to fear God that we may be wise, but then how can we love Him? This is resolved through noting that fear leads to love. A simple chain of logic: God is in control, so we fear him, so we follow His commands, so we love Him, so our fear dies. Importantly, this also puts to rest worries about fear's negative connotations. Certainly, fear God! But it is so that you may love Him.</p>

<p style="font-family:georgia;color:rgb(68,68,68);">From this, then, the story of wisdom involves love. Specifically, it involves loving God. At this point the picture of wisdom becomes more complete. If we love God, we will love those around us. We will lift up the lowly and serve those in need. This confirms James' statement that "wisdom from above is first pure, but then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of compassion and good fruits, impartial, and sincere." Of course, this contrasts with worldly wisdom on many occasions, which often suggests a course of action relative to oneself instead of relative to others.</p>

<p style="font-family:georgia;color:rgb(68,68,68);">This picture could appear as failing to satisfy the typical perception of wisdom as informing the decisions we make. Decisions such as what to study, how to spend money, how to respond to social situations. Maybe some of these choices don't truly matter in the overall scope of life. Yet even in them can wisdom be found. Mentally distance yourself from a situation, and see how a decision will ultimately impact the overarching trajectory of your life. If one path allows you to love God more, following it is wise as suggested earlier. For those ways that don't seem to affect this capacity for love, look again: you will make a wise decision in selecting whatever option is best for you personally. For only at your best will you serve God wholeheartedly. As you grasp more the things that are best for you, you will grow in wisdom. Reach for it as only you can.</p>
