    Stories abound today concerning the moral failures of leaders, pastors being a prime example. Those from Mark Driscoll, to Perry Noble, to Bill Hybels have well illustrated the picture that some people hold power who should not. The unfortunate part of this lies in our search for role models. Society’s leaders present a natural choice for such models through their charisma and rarely questioned nature, which proves especially true for pastors. However, when those presented as the best of society fail, whether through adultery, alcoholism, a domineering nature, etc., they leave destruction in their wake as those who once believed in them and learned from them see the fall of their idols. In this comes a key understanding about human nature. Speaking in extremes, no one will be loving all the time. No one will be loyal all the time. No one will always do what is right. Even those who from an outside perspective live in constant kindness will at some point waver from it. All people fall short of perfection (Romans 3:23). This hurts. If I ever lose my faith, I can almost guarantee that it will be because of the hate I see in Christians around me – people who are meant to live in love, support their enemies, care without asking for anything in return. Indeed, many today have left the church for the same reason. Nevertheless, in this lies the mistaken belief that we can judge God’s character by examining those who claim to follow Him. Instead of looking to followers of God, we must look at God Himself, for in Him we find the ultimate role model.</p>

    Jesus lived the life that we look for in those around us. Truly, no one could be more inspirational. Love encompassed His entire life. When people came to Him with pain, He listened and wept alongside them. He served those whom society had forgotten. He restored people’s health spiritually, mentally, physically, and relationally. Never once did He ask for anything in return. Never did He ask for praise, attention, or money. Ironically, from the calling of Levi to Luke 9:57-62, when He <i>did</i> ask people to follow Him, He had not even done anything for them! His striking character continues to grow the closer it is examined, for His very service to the lowly of society angered the very people who ended up murdering Him. For example, consider the healing of a man on a Sabbath (Luke 6:6-11). The Pharisees refused even to do good on a Sabbath, as such an action would apparently detract from God’s day of rest. Jesus, however, made a point of showing them this man and healing him, that they may know the importance of caring for others. Despite His love, the Pharisees and the scribes only grew enraged, an anger which culminated in the cross. Speaking of the cross, at His very crucifixion He prayed, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:29). Finally, no description of Jesus would be complete without pointing out His living in perfect union with God, setting aside time to be with Him and trusting in Him through the events of each day. Whatever terrible things Christians are ultimately irrelevant in the sense that they cannot take away from who God is, exemplified perfectly through Jesus.</p>

    Perhaps actions do speak louder than words, but in Jesus’ speech He gives additional proof of His brilliance. He understood that all people can love their friends, but one who truly loves will also love their enemies (Luke 6:35). The same verse further speaks of giving without expecting anything in return, which calls to mind His aforementioned refusal of service for all that He did. He knew that sacrifice involves giving everything, not giving a lot (Luke 21:1-4). Instead of looking at outside appearances, He examined the heart, valuing the honesty of the tax collector and the sweet innocence of children (Luke 18:9-17).</p>

    I don’t really feel the need to make the case for Jesus because He makes an overwhelming case for Himself. But it is important to remember Him as our role model. We can look to people all we want. Nevertheless, they will fail, and indeed it seems silly to look to humans when Jesus set such a powerful example. This of course does not preclude listening and learning from each other or celebrating when people do good. It simply means that our hope and our faith lies in God alone. In knowing Him and molding ourselves in His image, we will never lose.</p>
